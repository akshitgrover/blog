Nodejs a very popular javascript runtime environment known for itâ€™s asynchronous nature and server side application development. It has many core modules or say paradigms which are not well explored yet and are used in every application (sounds a bit confusing right?), One of such core modules is `Stream`.

Everything in nodejs is about efficient process handling (multiple requests) on a single thread. As a nodejs developer one just has to think about the application, everything else, such as `efficiency`, `multiple connections` etc. is taken care of by nodejs.
